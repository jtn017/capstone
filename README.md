# V2X Motorcycle HUD
![alt text](docs/images/v2x.png?raw=true)

The V2X Motorcycle HUD project seeks to create a V2X (vehicle-to-everything) system.
The motivation behind this effort is to improve motorcycle group riding experiences.
The final system consists of 2 motorcycles (wherein each motorcycle mounts a full V2X Motorcycle HUD setup).
A custom waveform is used to transmit HUD data (shown on the HUD) and audio (played through speakers).
This information includes the other vehicleâ€™s name, geographic location, speed, directions, and distance to next step.

## System Diagram and Equipment
![alt text](docs/images/apparatus.png?raw=true)

As shown in the diagram above, each motorcycle HUD in the V2X system consists of these components:

- [Avnet ZedBoard](https://www.avnet.com/wps/portal/us/products/avnet-boards/avnet-board-families/zedboard/)
  - [AD-FMCOMMS4-EBZ](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/eval-ad-fmcomms4-ebz.html)
  - Wi-Fi Antennas (2x)
- [PYNQ Z2](http://www.pynq.io/board.html)
- [ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B081CSJV2V/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- [OLED Display](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09JWN8K99/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1)

## Dataflow
![alt text](docs/images/dataflow.png?raw=true)

The data flow is from one V2X TX to the other V2X RX is described as:

- ZedBoard1 SW creates a data packet and processes it (via TX Baseband/Modulator SW)
- ZedBoard1 SW buffers processed data for transmission via DMA and the Digital-to-Analog (DAC).
- ZedBoard2 PL processes the transmitted waveform (via RX Demodulator IP)
- ZedBoard2 PL stores demodulated data into a RAM accessed via UIO on the ARM.
- ZedBoard2 SW retrieves demodulated data and processes it (via RX Baseband SW) 
- ZedBoard2 SW sends data to HUD using HTTP requests

## Waveform Description and Data Packet
The waveform consists of QPSK modulated data on the WiFi band (both TX/RX using the same frequency).
TDMA is used to schedule transmission between motorcycles, and also to calculate distance between the motorcycles.

- Throughput: 78.4 kbps
- Minimum Required Sampling Frequency: 1.58 Msps
- Carrier Frequency: 2.4GHz (WiFi band)
- Maximum Doppler Frequency: 2,400,715 Hz (max speed of 100 MPH)
- Maximum Offset Frequency: 715 Hz
- Maximum Frequency Error: 781.25 KHz
- Maximum detection distance: 0.25mi (0.4km)

The data packet consists of 784 total bits, where the first 144 bits contain HUD data, and the next 640 bits contain audio samples.
| Parameter                         | Data type               |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Identifier                        | char[4]      (32 bits)  |
| Latitude                          | float        (32 bits)  |
| Longitude                         | float        (32 bits)  |
| Speed (mph)                       | uint8_t      (8  bits)  |
| Directions                        | uint8_t      (8  bits)  |
| Distance to next step             | float        (32 bits)  |
| Audio (mono, 16bit, 4kHz, 0.01s)  | uint16_t[40] (640 bits) |

## Future Tasks
The current build (as of June 6, 2022) requires more work in order to get a more complete system build working.
Currently this build has gotten as far as an OTA loopback with a singular ZedBoard (no success with a 2 way link so far).
The following list states the components that need more debugging/verification/implementation.

- PLL
  - Does not consistently behave as desired
  - Most likely cause of 2 way link issue (clocks on each board likely not matching)
- TDMA
  - Unable to start implementation since 2 way link never established
- Distance between riders
  - Unable to start implementation since TDMA never implemented
